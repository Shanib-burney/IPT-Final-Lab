    <!-- 3) It's been 28 years since html was first released but people still have 
        difficulty in writing html, Bob on the other
         hand is an expert of html even he has provided a tool 
         
         to generate html most use tag of table to help inexperienced peoples,
          people only give the number of rows required in a table and Bob's
           web page show the table structure, for example if someone gives 3 
           as an input to bob page, the page displays following as output:
 
<table>
        	<tr> 1 </tr>
        	<tr> 2 </tr>
        	<tr> 3 </tr>
</table>
 
It shows as many rows as are provided in the request, it really has helped the non-technical people to generate html, you are required to implement the same web page as Bob (Hint: No server side programing needed, use &lt; to show < and &gt; to show > on screen). -->
<label for="">Enter number of rows for Table</label>
<input type="text" id="myinput" type="number"> <br>
<button>Generate HTML</button>
<div class="table"></div>

<script>
function generate(){
   var value = $("#myinput").val();
    var table = $(".table");
    value = Number(value);
    var string = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < value; i++) {
      if(i === 0){
          string = "&lt;table&gt; <br>"
      }
      string = string + `&lt;tr&gt; ${i}&lt;/tr&gt; <br>`;
      if(i === value - 1){
          string = string + "&lt;/table&gt;"
      }
    }
    table.html(string)
}
$("button").click(()=>{
    generate()
